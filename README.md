# AutoGit
Another attempt at a Github automation script 

- use github api to automate simple/complext tasks 
- use mongodb for local storage `mongod --dbpath ~/mongodb-data`
[x] Pass YAML file through for config
- Ensure approval can be achieved
-

### TODO: 
- Display environment name - Iterate over the environments deployed. 
### NOTES 
- Fetches latest release from repo and displays name and release URL
- Fetches workflows with status, name and url. If release name/tag matches
    - Helps display the workflows that have deployed that tag
-
